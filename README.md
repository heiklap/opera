# opera

Conducting operations with steps and moving in phases.
Simple, not using "upper-level" packages or imported structures.
Real usage demands building extra lib, that imports opera, and 
handles io activities, renders common libraries, control flow aso. 
Customer / user data should be in separate files.
Presentation in browser could be done with AngularDart.

## Usage

A simple usage example (just for Dart sample, lol):

    import 'package:opera/opera.dart';

    main() {
      var awesome = new Awesome();
    }
